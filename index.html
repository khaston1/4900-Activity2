            <p>
I’m a senior who is pursuing a Bachelors in Management Information Systems. I enjoy cybersecurity and networking the most. 
My outside hobbies include music and playing guitar along with collecting and flipping them . 
I do have some experience with GitHub as teachers have used it to distribute their assignments in previous classes. 
I currently work in Assets Protection at Target also.
